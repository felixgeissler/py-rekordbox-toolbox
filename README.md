# Rekordbox Cover Fix

After a quick lookup of my DJ music I noticed, that Pioneer's Rekordbox application will only show album covers
tagged as 'Front' cover. Therefor this hacky Python script will fix this issue by renaming corresponding covertags.

* Related Rekordbox version: 5.8.5

## Getting started (OSX)
